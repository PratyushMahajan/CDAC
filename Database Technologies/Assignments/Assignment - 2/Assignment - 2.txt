Introducing Relational Databases.


1. Which field of the Customers table is the primary key?  
   - Answer: CNUM  
   - Reason:
     A primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. In the CUSTOMERS table, the CNUM field is the primary key because each customer has a unique number in that column.

2. What is the 4th column of the Customers table?  
   - Answer: RATING  
   - Reason: The columns in the CUSTOMERS table are:  
     1. CNUM  
     2. CNAME  
     3. CITY  
     4. RATING  
     So, the fourth column is RATING.

3. What is another word for row? For column?  
   - Answer:  
     - Another word for row is record.  
     - Another word for column is field.  
   
     In a database, a row (or record) holds data about one thing, like one customer’s information. A column (or field) holds the same type of data for all rows, such as names or ratings.

4. Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?  

     - Tables in SQL don’t have a fixed order unless we use an order by clause. Without sorting, we can’t say which rows come first.  
     - Also, if a query doesn’t use a limit clause, the result might show more or fewer than five rows, or the whole table. That’s why we can’t always see exactly the first five rows.
